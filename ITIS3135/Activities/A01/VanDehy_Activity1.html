<h1>Web-Based Applications Design and Development</h1>
<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><i><b>Zeke Van Dehy</b></i> is a Software Engineering student who enjoys basketball and the mountains. I am originally from Colorado! I studied abroad at the University of Sydney last semester (until I was recalled).</p>

<p><i><b>Zeke Van Dehy</b></i> I expect to develop a better understanding of what goes into making a Web Applications and how to make them look like professional websites (unlike what I currently make haha!). <em>By the end of the semester I want to be able to confidently answer "Why would you learn web development or hire a web developer when you can just use a website like Wix?"</em> </p>

<p><i><b>Zeke Van Dehy</b></i> loves learning this course web-based application design and development and thinks it is really important for teachers to teach how to do client-side development. He wishes you all the best!</p>
